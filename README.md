# CLIP Implementation on BMS dataset 

### Authors: Juan Sebastián Gómez & Juan Velásquez Medina

Based on the article of [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-implementation-of-openai-clip-model-a-tutorial-ace6ff01d9f2) we implement a model that it's able to generate and categorize a set of internacional chemical identifiers (InChl) labels into their respective skeletal formulas. This dataset is obtained from the [Bristol-Myers Squibb – Molecular Translation Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bms-molecular-translation).
